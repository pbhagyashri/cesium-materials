## How to run the project

### Installing depedencies

This project has **two seperate package.json files**. One in **server (root)** directory and another one in **client directory**
Please run **npm install** from both directories to install all dependencies

To start the project run following command

## npm run dev

I have setup concurrently to start both backend server (nodeJS) and Front-End server (React)

### Database

Database is hosted in Atlas clould once you install dependencies, you should be connected automatically to the database.

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app (browser should be automatically fired though)
Please make sure you don't have any other servers running on **port 5000 and 3000**
